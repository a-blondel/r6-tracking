# What is/was it ?

Designed for Rainbow Six Siege, it was an Android app to check anyboby's stats and track their game results.

**This app isn't maintained anymore** (last supported season was Shifting Tides - march 10, 2020), many websites like https://r6.tracker.network/ does the job very well !

The support was limited to :
- Platform : PS4
- Regions : EMEA & NCSA
